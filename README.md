# C code Compiler
## This is a compiler project made with Java that uses ANTLR grammar. 
The source code is translated into assembly code for a virtual machine (VM).
[TASK IN DETAIL](https://github.com/parasxdhikari/CompilerC/blob/main/CompilerQuestion.md)
- The source code is Cymbol which is a dumbed down version of C.
- The target code is Pcode which is a form of assembly language.
- To simplify intermediate code generation, use StringTemplate!
- Unit Tests are included
- Also includes the answer for this [DSL AFSM Task](https://github.com/parasxdhikari/CompilerC/blob/main/DSLAutomaten.md)
