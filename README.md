# C code Compiler
## This is a compiler the source code is translated into target code for a virtual machine (VM).
- The source code is Cymbol which is a dumber down version of C.
- The target code is Pcode which is a form of assembly language.
- To simplify intermediate code generation, use StringTemplate!
